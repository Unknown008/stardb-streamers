Just a little project I wanted to work on that helps getting visibility over the streamers in the Star DB community for the Twitch Streaming Incentive Event.

# FAQs
**Q: I want to be on the list. How can I get on it?**  
A: I will update the list based on the users on the StarDB discord in the channel for the twitch event. Post there and I'll eventually get to it (or if more people want to help keep the list updated, they will update it).

**Q: There's this bug in your app. How do I report it?**  
A: You can create a [new issue on the GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Unknown008/stardb-streamers/issues/new) or reach me on my [discord](https://discord.gg/UsMBKxa) or send me a DM to my discord tag (Unknown008). Do be aware that timezones are a thing and that I have a full time job, so I may take some time to reply.

**Q: I have these and those great suggestions! How go I go about telling you so you can add them?**  
A: It's great that you have suggestions. I don't know if I'm skilled enough to implement them, but feel free to reach me on the links from the previous question.

I some of the assets I use have been obtained from the Wiki. Been liking ZZZ so far and will hopefully continue to like it.
